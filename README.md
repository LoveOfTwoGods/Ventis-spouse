☁️🍃"I shall charm you with the sweetest of tunes, a most enchanting verse. You and I shall be as one as the wind and the stars, in this fleeting life of which we have been blessed..."💐💖

🌨️"My beloved, how I love your company.But I must bid you farewell, one and all. For I have learned of a place beyond the horizon, where I alone must make a stand.My journey there will be long and hard.Though it would be so easy for me to falter. But I will be brave and strong.And if I fall, I will rise once more, in every age. For my love of you"🥀
