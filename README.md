☁️🍃"I shall charm you with the sweetest of tunes, a most enchanting verse. You and I shall be as one as the wind and the stars, in this fleeting life of which we have been blessed..."💐💖
...

🌨️"My beloved, how I love your company.But I must bid you farewell, one and all. For I have learned of a place beyond the horizon, where I alone must make a stand.My journey there will be long and hard.Though it would be so easy for me to falter. But I will be brave and strong.And if I fall, I will rise once more, in every age. For my love of you"🥀

 "The winds dance in your presence, for you their song they sing.
And I, as the Anemo Archon, for you I play and sing.
May our hearts entwine, with you the breeze I breathe, as you the stars of hope that I now cling..."![b544c288](https://github.com/Ventis-spouse/Ventis-spouse/assets/154030415/b73c3d81-b8e4-453b-b3a6-2c874eea1289)
